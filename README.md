# Snake Game
Hey There!
## Description
This is a simple Snake Game built using Python's `turtle` module. The game features a snake that moves around the screen, eats food to grow in size, and keeps track of the score. The game ends when the snake collides with the screen boundaries.

## Features
- Classic snake movement (Up, Down, Left, Right)
- Random food placement
- Score tracking
- Game over when the snake touches the wall

## Installation
Ensure you have Python installed on your system. You can download it from [python.org](https://www.python.org/).

### Install Dependencies
No external libraries are required; the game is built using Python's standard library modules.

## How to Run
1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Ensure the following Python files are present in the same directory:
   - `snake.py`
   - `food.py`
   - `scoreboard.py`
3. Run the `main.py` script using:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Controls
- **Arrow Keys**: Move the snake Up, Down, Left, or Right

## How to Play
1. Start the game by running the script.
2. Use the arrow keys to control the snake.
3. Eat food to increase the score and make the snake grow longer.
4. Avoid hitting the screen boundaries.
5. The game ends if the snake collides with the wall.
6. Click on the screen to exit when the game is over.

## Code Structure
- **`main.py`**: The main script to run the game.
- **`snake.py`**: Handles snake movement and growth.
- **`food.py`**: Manages food placement and refresh.
- **`scoreboard.py`**: Handles score updates and game-over message.

## Future Improvements
- Add self-collision detection to make the game more challenging.
- Implement different difficulty levels.
- Introduce power-ups or obstacles.
